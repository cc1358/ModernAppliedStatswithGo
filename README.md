From Gelman and Vehtari (2021) we select the computer intensive statsitical method of bootstrapping and simulation-based inference. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly resampling from the observed data with replacement. This allows for estimating the sample distribution of a statistic (in this case we will focus on mean and confidence intervals) without making any assumptions about the underlying distributon of the data.

In R, we can install the package "boot" to perform bootstrapping on some reandomly generated sample data. This only takes one line (see line 18 on boot.R) to perform the bootstrapping and another line (see line 29 on boot.R) to calculate the bootstrap confidence interval.

In Go, the procedure is a bit more complex, but it rewards us with a signficant performance boost. The file boot.go develops a bootstrapping procedure akin to the R program with the same number of boostrap resamples and confidence interval calcualtion. But we add much more. The bootstrapping process is parallelized using goroutines to take advantage of mult-core processors and speed up the computation. Tests can easily be added with Github Copilot.
